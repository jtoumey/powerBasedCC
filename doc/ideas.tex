\section{Ideas}

\subsection{Initial}


\begin{itemize}
   \item Purchase Raspberry Pi Zero
   \item Purchase Nordic Semiconductor ANT+ chip\todo[color=green]{The more I think about it, the more I think we need to use the dongle...}
   \item General steps\todo{any thoughts on this procedure?}\todo[color=green]{We should try to find ways to work simultaneously on different things to make things smoother. Fewer merges, etc.}
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item Purchase ANT+ Chip
      \item Work to adapt a C++ ANT+ library to receive data stream from peripheral devices
      \item Implement calculations and cycling features
      \item Design the user interface using QT Creator\todo[color=green]{QT looks like a pain. Evaluate other options, Tkinter?}
      \item Assemble the hardware  
   \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}


\section{Features}
\begin{itemize}
   \item CP curve
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Curve fit
      \item Data file with best power for ever interval
   \end{itemize}
   \item W' implementation
\end{itemize}



\section{Screen Choice}
On screen choice, I think it will decide how we interact with the device. Basically, whether or not it is a touch screen. An additional note: displays can interact with an RPi with either the GPIO pins or a serial display output. I think we need to use the serial display output to free up the GPIO for any other devices. The touch screen I have uses GPIO which would make this hard. 

\begin{itemize}
   \item Touch screen\todo{do you know if any units have touch screen and buttons? actually i think the pioneer head unit does.. maybe EDGE 510 as well? have to look how touch screen perform when sweat/wet}\todo[color=green]{I think 510 has both. I think we can do JUST touch screen. Resistive touch screen has no problem with sweat.}.
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Resistive
         \item Capacitive - \textbf{NO}
      \end{itemize}
   \item Just normal screen with buttons
\end{itemize}
